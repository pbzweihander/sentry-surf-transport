# sentry-surf-transport

Sentry transport implementation with surf, but without surf's default features.
So users can choose which backend (e.g. curl, http-client, ...) surf use.

Almost copy-paste from [the original sentry code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/blob/0.23.0/sentry/src/transports)
